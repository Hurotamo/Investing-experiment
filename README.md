# 3-Year Investment Experiment  

**Start Date**: January 1, 2025  
**Goal**: Transform ₱5,000 into almost **₱1 million** through consistent cryptocurrency growth at a monthly return of 30%.  

---

## 📜 Experiment Overview  

This experiment leverages the power of **compounding** by reinvesting profits every month. Starting with an initial investment of ₱5,000, the goal is to achieve exponential growth over 3 years.  

### 🔢 Formula:  
The growth is calculated using the **Compound Interest Formula**:  

\[
A = P \times (1 + r)^n
\]

Where:  
- \(P = ₱5,000\) (Initial Investment)  
- \(r = 0.30\) (Monthly Growth Rate)  
- \(n = 36\) (Number of Months)
